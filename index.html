  <h2> Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>Having been educated in an independent school, by the generosity of a sponsoring foundation, making the most of all available opportunities, academic and extracurricular, is second nature to me. This has driven me to conduct research abroad in France, as part of my Chemical Engineering (MEng) degree, and display flexibility by adapting to a professional working schedule and learning a new language. My time as captain of my Sixth Form football and rugby teams has made me comfortable leading and motivating groups while relating to a wide range of personalities. The commitment to constant self-improvement, which I have developed from this, has left me eager for a new challenge.
